# This code repository allows to reproduce results presented in Malmstr√∏m et al. (2016). 
# The pipeline described here extracts, aligns, and filters sequences for mitochondrial markers
# from all new unitig assemblies as well previously published genome sequences available from ENSEMBL.

# To run this pipeline, cd into directory "scripts" and run the script "start.sh". However, the
# required input data is not included in this code repository due to space limitations, and will
# first need to be added before the pipeline can be executed. Specifically, files need to be added
# to two directories:
# data/subjects/full/
# data/subjects/mitochondrial/
# Unitig assembly data available at http://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.120269 (all files ending
# in *.utg.fasta.gz) should be downloaded, copied to directory data/subjects/full/, and decompressed.
# Make sure that the file names of the unitig assembly fasta files then match the names listed in
# file data/subjects/full/files_that_should_be_placed_here.txt
# In addition, sequence data for genome sequences from ENSEMBL should be downloaded and placed in the
# directory data/subjects/mitochondrial/. These fasta files can be reduced to contain only the mito-
# chondrial genome sequences of each species. Note that we used sequences from the ENSEMBL version 78,
# and that all files should be names as specified in file 
# data/subjects/mitochondrial/files_that_should_be_placed_here.txt
