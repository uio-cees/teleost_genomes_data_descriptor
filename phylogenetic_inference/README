# This pipeline allows to reproduce results presented in Malmstr√∏m et al (2016).
# It uses mitochondrial sequence alignments provided in directory data/mitochondrial
# to generate a concatenated alignment and runs RAxML (which needs to be installed)
# for maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference.

# The input alignments were previously produced with the pipeline described in
# directory ../ortholog_identification, and should be identical to those that are
# written to directory ../ortholog_identification/analysis/alignments/mitochondrial/04
# after running the ortholog identification pipeline.

# To execute this pipeline, cd into directory "scripts" and run the script "start.sh".
